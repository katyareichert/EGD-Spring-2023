Alex:
Hey Mellie, how are you today?

Mellie:
Hi Alex. It's been a rough day. 
I just went through a difficult breakup.

Alex:
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mellie. Breakups can be tough.
Do you want to talk about it?

Mellie:
It's just been hard, you know? I thought things were going well, but it didn't work out. I'm feeling a bit lost.

Alex:
Breakups can be tough, but remember that you're not alone. You have friends and family who care about you, and you're strong enough to get through this.

Mellie:
Thanks, Alex. I appreciate your kind words.

Alex:
Of course, anytime. I think for today, you'll need some...

[SELECTION]

Alex:
Patience to give yourself time to heal and Serenity to find peace within yourself.

Mellie:
That sounds like just what I need right now.

[MINIGAME]

Alex:
Here you go. Take care of yourself, Mellie.

Mellie:
Thank you, Alex. I'll do my best.

Alex:
You're welcome. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you.

Mellie:
Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it.
