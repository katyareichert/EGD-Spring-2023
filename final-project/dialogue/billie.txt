Alex:
Good morning!
Anything special I can help with today?

Billie:
Actually, yes!
I'm picking up my parents from the airport.
They're flying in from the Philippines.

Alex:
That's exciting! Have they been here before?

Billie:
Yeah, they come to visit every couple years.
But it's always nice to have them here.

Alex:
Definitely.
Do you have anything special planned?

Billie:
Not really, just spending some time together
and catching up. Maybe taking them to some of
my favorite spots around the city.

Alex:
Sounds like a good plan.
You know, I think you'll enjoy...

have a great day with your family.
