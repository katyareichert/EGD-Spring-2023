Alex:
Good morning, Sylvia!
How are you doing today?

Sylvia:
To be honest, still a bit sad about my dog.
But I've been looking into fostering puppies.

Alex:
That's wonderful, Sylvia! Fostering can be a
really rewarding experience.

Sylvia:
Yeah, I'm really excited about the prospect
of giving another dog a loving home.

Alex:
I'm sure you'll be a great foster parent.
It takes a lot of courage and kindness to
open your heart to an animal in need.

Sylvia: Thank you, Alex. It's been a tough time, but I'm trying to focus on the positive things.

Alex:
That in mind, I think you'll love some...
