Alex:
Good morning! What can I get for you today?

Sylvia:
Hey Alex...

Alex:
Is everything okay? You seem a bit down.

Sylvia:
I had to put my dog down last night.
He was my best friend for over a decade.

Alex:
I'm so sorry to hear that, truly.
Can I offer you some...

Sylvia:
Thanks, Alex.

Alex:
Losing a pet can be incredibly difficult.

Sylvia:
He was always there for me, you know?
Always happy to see me and never judged me.

Alex:
It sounds like he was an amazing companion.

Sylvia:
He was. I just don't know what I'm going to
do without him now that he's gone.

Alex:
I know it may not make things easier, but
sometimes it's good to take comfort in the
memories and love that you shared.

Sylvia:
Thank you. I needed to hear that.

Alex:
Here you go. And if you need anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.
