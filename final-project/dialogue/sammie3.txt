Alex:
Hey Sammie, how are you doing today?

Sammie:
Hi Alex, I'm feeling a little down.
It was a rough night.

Alex:
I'm sorry to hear that. Take your time, and
let me know when you're ready to order.

Sammie:
I'll have something warm and comforting to
cheer me up, please.

Alex:
Sure thing, coming right up.

Alex:
Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
I'm here to listen if you need someone.

Sammie:
Thank you, Alex. It's just been a tough night
with some personal issues on my mind.

Alex:
I understand.
Sometimes life can throw us curveballs, and
it's okay to feel sad or overwhelmed.
Remember, you're not alone,
and there are people who care about you.

I appreciate your kind words, Alex.
You always know how to lift my spirits.
