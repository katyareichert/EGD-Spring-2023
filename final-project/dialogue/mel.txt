Alex:
Hey Mel, how are you today?

Mel:
Hi Alex. It's been a rough day.
I just went through a difficult breakup.

Alex:
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mel.
Breakups can be tough.
Do you want to talk about it?

Mel:
It's just been hard, you know?
I thought things were going well, but it
didn't work out. I'm feeling a bit lost.

Alex:
Breakups can be tough, but remember that
you're not alone. You have friends and family
who care about you, and you're strong enough
to get through this.

Mel:
Thanks, Alex. I appreciate your kind words.

Alex:
Of course, anytime.
I think for today, I'll make you something to
give yourself time and find peace.

Here you go. Take care of yourself, Mel.

Mel:
Thank you, Alex. I'll do my best.

Alex:
You're welcome.
If you ever need someone to talk to,
I'm here for you.

Mel:
Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it.
