Welcome to Comfort Cafe!

Uno:
Hi there! Can I get a coffee with some almond milk please?

Alex:
Absolutely not!

Uno:
Oh, that's interesting...
I'm not sure I follow.

Alex:
It's pretty simple!
Just tell me a little bit about your day and what you have planned,
and I'll suggest a drink and pastry that will help you through it.

Uno:
Well, I'm feeling pretty good today.
I have a presentation at work this afternoon,
so I guess I need to be focused and confident.

Alex:
Excellent! How about...

Alex:
It's delicious and indulgent, perfect for rewarding yourself after a job well done.

Uno:
Wow, that sounds great! You really know your stuff.

Alex:
Perfect, I'll go ahead and make your drink now!

Enjoy your drink and pastry, and good luck with your presentation!
