Alex:
Welcome to Comfort Cafe!
I'm Alex, your local barista.

Uno:
Hi there! Nice to meet you.
Can I get a coffee with oat milk please?

Alex:
Absolutely not!
Just kidding, but we do things a little 
differently here. Instead of taking specific
orders, we let the drinks choose you!

Uno:
Oh, that's interesting...
I'm not sure I follow.

Alex:
It's pretty simple!
Just tell me a little bit about your day, and 
I'll suggest a drink and pastry that will add
a little boost to help you through it.

Uno:
Well, I'm feeling pretty good today.
I have a presentation at work this afternoon,
so I guess I need to be calm and confident.

Alex:
Excellent! How about...

Smells delicious!

Alex:
Enjoy your drink and pastry, 
and good luck with your presentation!
